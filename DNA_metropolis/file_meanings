paper_main.cpp:		The simulation setup as it was used in the main simulation for the paper. The heterochromatin spring compaction used in this simulation is slightly higher than the value necessary to reproduce the curves of the Mateos-Langerak paper. This is expected, as we don't include any spatial scaffold rearrangements that might be made during replication. If, for instance, there were replication factories that bring forks into 3D-proximity, the heterochromatin spring constants would have to be larger to give a realistic result. (I.e., the increase in spring constants serves as an approximation to the additional proximity effect caused by scaffolding rearrangements.)

paper_main78_alterna.cpp:	This is the same thing as paper_main.cpp, with the exception that the spring constants are chosen such, that they reproduce the Mateos-Langerak measurements as close as possible. Chromatin compaction in these simulations is slightly too low, since we don't include any 3D effects (see above).

main_rl100.cpp:		This is the simulation that was used to estimate what replication would look like if the connection-number-variation approach of Mateos-Langerak was used. The results are unrealistic, as is shown in the paper supplement.
Not using the exact approach of Mateos-Langerak is not as shady as it seems, since Mateos-Langerak et al. themselves need to use a scaling factor for their results to match the experimental data. Our approach essentially allows us to do it without the scaling factor.
